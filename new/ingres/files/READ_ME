.../files

This directory contains the support files needed for INGRES to
run.  The critical ones are:

dayfile7
	The dayfile printed by the tty monitor when INGRES starts
	up.
dbtmplt7
	The file that describes the database, used by creatdb.
equel7
	The process table used by INGRES when called from an EQUEL
	program.
error7_0
error7_1
error7_2
error7_3
error7_4
error7_5
error7_6
	The files containing the text of error messages.
proctab7
	The process table used by INGRES when it is invoked normally.
procx7
	The process talbe used by INGRES when it is invoked
	as "ingresx".
startup
	A file executed by the monitor at startup, typically
	defining a few basic macros.
usage
	A file printed if the parameters to INGRES are wrong.
	This can be as terse or as verbose as necessary, given the
	sophistication of your users.
users
	A list of valid INGRES users, their internal code, and
	their capabilities.  More below.

Every user on your system who is going to use INGRES \must/ be
included in the "users" file.  This file looks much like the
/etc/passwd file, with fields separated by colons, etc.  The
first, third, and fourth fields are the login name, user id,
and group ids respectively, exactly like the /etc/passwd file.
The second field is that user's internal code, which is always
exactly two printable characters.  There is also an octal field
that describes capabilities; the principle capability is the
000001 bit which allows that person to create databases.

Users that are not entered into the users file WILL NOT be
able to use INGRES.

This file can be set up for everyone on your system by using
the "usersetup" command.
