 *		@(#)equeltut.q	1.2	(ULTRIX)	2/1/85
 */

#
/*
** This	is intended as a tutorial example of  an  Equel	 program.
** You	should	be  familiar  with  both  C and	Quel before going
** through the examples.  The program may be run to see	 how  the
** examples  actually  work.  To compile and run this program you
** should run the following shell commands:
**
**		equel equeltut.q
**		cc equeltut.c -lq
**		a.out
**
** The first command invokes the Equel	pre-processor  which  in-
** serts  code	to send	queries	to INGRES.  The	output is left in
** the file "equeltut.c" in  this  case.   In  general,	the  pre-
** processor is	invoked	as:
**
**		equel [-d] [-f]	[-r] file1.q [file2.q ...]
**
** The output is left in "file1.c", etc.  The -d flag tells Equel
** to  leave line number information in	the file so that run time
** errors can be associated with the proper query.
**
** It is possible to use the C-preprocessor to include files with
** Equel statements and/or declarations	in it if these files have
** names ending	in ".q.h". Such	files will be processed	by equel,
** and	a C version left in the	file ending in ".c.h", which will
** be #included	by the C pre-processor.	Files which are	#included
** but whose names do not end in ".q.h"	will be	ignored	by Equel.
*/


/*
** Equel uses the same syntax as Quel in almost	all cases.  There
** are	a  few	differences  between Equel and Quel and	also some
** subtleties in interfaceing Quel and C constructs.  Some impor-
** tant	points are:
**
**	C-variables declared  to  Equel	 are  used  as	variables
** throughout Equel statements,	except inside  strings or when preceded
** by the non-referencing operator '#'.	 In particular,	be  care-
** ful with variable names which are the same as domain	names.
**
**	All strings passed to C-variables  from	 INGRES	 will  be
** null	 terminated.   This  will  make	them one byte longer than
** they	were in	the relation, so you must declare character arrays
** to be one byte longer than the domain from which the data will
** come.
**
**	Retrieve statements with no result relation have  a  dif-
** ferent  interpretation  in  Equel than in Quel.  There will be
** many	examples of this.
