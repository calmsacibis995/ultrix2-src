/*
**	Update reads a batch file written by the
**	access method routines (openbatch, addbatch, closebatch)
**	and performs the updates stored in the file.
**
**	It assumes that it is running in the database. It
**	is driven by the data in the Batchhd struct (see ../batch.h).
**	If the relation has a secondary index then update calls
**	secupdate. As a last step the batch file is removed.
**
**	The global flag Batch_recovery is tested in case
**	of an error. It should be FALSE if update is being
**	run as the dbu deferred update processor. It should
**	be TRUE if it is being used as part of the recovery
**	procedure.
