/*
**  DESTROY RELATION
**
**	The relations in pv are destroyed.  This involves three steps:
**	1 - remove tuple from relation relation
**	2 - remove tuples from attribute relation
**	3 - unlink physical file
**
**	If the relation is a secondary index, the entry is removed
**	from the index relation, and the primary relation is set to
**	be "not indexed" (unless there is another index on it).
**
**	If the relation has an index, all its indexes are also
**	destroyed.
**
**	If any errors occured while destroying the relations,
**	then the last error number is returned, otherwise
**	0 is returned.
**
**	If any query modification was defined on the relation,
**	the qrymod catalogues are updated.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		32
