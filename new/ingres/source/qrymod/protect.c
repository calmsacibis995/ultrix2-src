/*
**  PROTECT -- protection algorithm
**
**	This module performs the INGRES protection algorithm, as
**	presented in Stonebraker & Rubinstein, "The INGRES Protection
**	System", with a few modifications.
**
**	The basic algorithm is as follows:
**
**	The algorithm is applied once to each variable used in the
**	query.  Each variable has an initial check performed to
**	determine applicability -- if the current user owns the
**	relation, or if the relation is specially marked as being
**	"all access to everyone", then the algorithm is skipped,
**	thereby having effectively no restriction.
**
**	The set of all such variables is computed in 'protect',
**	and then 'dopro' is called to process each of those.  This
**	is so the protection algorithm does not get applied recursively
**	to constraints which define more than one variable.  Notice
**	that this could in itself be a protection violation, if it
**	were acceptable to reference a relation you do not own in a
**	PERMIT statement.
**
**	The effective query mode for this variable is then computed.
**	This is the same as the query mode of the whole query if
**	the variable in question is the result variable, otherwise
**	it is "retrieve" mode.
**
**	The next step is to scan the query tree and create sets of
**	domains referenced.  Four sets are created:
**		uset -- the set of domains updated (actually,
**			referenced in the target list -- on a
**			retrieve, this will be the set of domains
**			retrieved to the user).
**		rset -- the set of domains retrieved in some
**			context other than the left hand side of
**			an equal sign.
**		aset -- the set of domains aggregated.  This only
**			includes domains aggregated with a simple
**			aggregate (not an aggregate function) with
**			no qualification, since it may be possible
**			to come up with too much information other-
**			wise.
**		qset -- the set of domains retrieved for use in
**			a qualification, but never stored.  This
**			includes domains in a qualification of an
**			aggregate or aggregate function.
**	For more details of domains in each of these sets, look at
**	the routine 'makedset'.
**
**	If we had a retrieve operation in the first place, we will
**	then merge 'uset' into 'rset' and clear 'uset', so that
**	now 'uset' only contains domains which are actually updated,
**	and 'rset' contains all domains which are retrieved.
**
**	Now that we know what is referenced, we can scan the protection
**	catalog.  We scan the entire catalog once for each variable
**	mentioned in the query (except as already taken care of as
**	described above).
**
**	We must create a set of all operations on this variable which
**	are not yet resolved, that is, for which no PERMIT statements
**	which qualify have been issued.  We store this set in the
**	variable "noperm".  As PERMIT statements are found, bits will
**	be cleared.  If the variable is not zero by the end of the
**	scan of the protection catalog, then we reject the query,
**	saying that we don't have permission -- giving us default
**	to deny.
**
**	For each tuple in the protection catalog for this relation,
**	we call "proappl" to see if it applies to this query.  This
**	routine checks the user, terminal, time of day, and so forth
**	(in fact, everything which is query-independent) and tells
**	whether this tuple might apply.
**
**	If the tuple passes this initial check, we then do the query-
**	dependent checking.  This amounts to calling "prochk" once
**	for each operation (and domain set) in the query.  What we
**	get back is a set of operations which this tuple applies to.
**	If zero, the tuple doesn't apply at all; otherwise, it
**	applies to at least one operation.  If it applies to some-
**	thing, we call it "interesting".
**
**	For "interesting" tuples, we now get the corresponding
**	qualification (if one exists), and disjoin it to a set of
**	protection constraints held in "pqual".  Also, we mark
**	any operations we found as having been done, by clearing
**	bits in "noperm".
**
**	When we have completed scanning the protection catalog,
**	we check "noperm".  If it is non-zero, then we have some
**	operation for which a PERMIT statement has not been issued,
**	and we issue an error message.  If this variable is ok,
**	then we go on and try the next variable.
**
**	When all variables have been accounted for, we check to
**	see if we have any qualifications collected from the
**	protection algorithm.  If so, we conjoin them to the
**	query tree.
**
**	Finally, we return the root of the modified tree.  This
**	tree is guaranteed to have no authorization violations,
**	and may be run as a regular query.
**
**	Parameters:
**		root -- the root of the tree.
**
**	Returns:
**		The root of the modified and authorized tree.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		A possible non-local return on access violation.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		50 - 59

**  MAKEDSET -- make domain reference sets
**
**	This routine creates some sets which reflect the usage of
**	domains for a particular variable.
**
**	The interesting nodes are 'case' labels in the large
**	switch statement which comprises most of the code.  To
**	describe briefly:
**
**	VAR nodes are easy: if they are for the current variable,
**		set the bit corresponding to the domain in the
**		'retrieval' set.  They can have no descendents,
**		so just return.
**	RESDOM nodes are also easy: they can be handled the same,
**		but the bit is set in the 'update' set instead.
**	AGHEAD nodes signal the beginning of an aggregate or
**		aggregate function.  In this case, we scan the
**		qualification first (noting that RESDOM and VAR
**		nodes are processed as 'qualification' sets
**		instead of 'retrieval' or 'update' sets).  Then,
**		if the aggregate has a WHERE clause or a BY list,
**		we treat it as a retrieve; otherwise, we call our-
**		selves recursively treating VAR nodes as 'aggregate'
**		types rather than 'retrieve' types.
**	BYHEAD nodes signal the beginning of a BY list.  The left
**		subtree (the actual BY-list) is processed with
**		RESDOM nodes ignored (since they are pseudo-domains
**		anyhow) and VAR nodes mapped into the 'qualification'
**		set.  Then we check the right subtree (which better
**		begin with an AOP node!) and continue processing.
**	AOP nodes must have a null left subtree, so we just drop
**		to the right subtree and iterate.  Notice that we
**		do NOT map VAR nodes into the 'aggregate' set for
**		this node, since this has already been done by the
**		AGHEAD node; also, this aggregate might be counted
**		as a retrieve operation instead of an aggregate
**		operation (as far as the protection system is con-
**		cerned) -- this has been handled by the AGHEAD
**		node.
**	All other nodes are processed recursively along both edges.
**
**	Parameters:
**		vn -- the variable number that we are currently
**			interested in.
**		tree -- the root of the tree to scan.  Notice that this
**			will in general be only one half of the tree --
**			makedset will be called once for the target
**			list and once for the qualification, with
**			different sets for the following parameters.
**		uset -- adjusted to be the set of all domains
**			updated.
**		rset -- adjusted to be the set of all domains
**			retrieved implicitly, that is, on the right-
**			hand-side of an assignment operator.
**		aset -- adjusted to be the set of all domains
**			aggregated.  Notice that this set is not
**			adjusted explicitly, but rather is passed
**			to recursive incarnations of this routine
**			as 'rset'.
**		qset -- adjusted to be the set of domains retrieved
**			implicitly in a qualification.  Like 'aset',
**			this is passed as 'rset' to recursive
**			incarnations.
**
**	Returns:
**		none

**  PROCHK -- query-dependent protection tuple check
**
**	This routine does the query-dependent part of checking
**	the validity of a protection tuple.  Unlike proappl,
**	which looked at aspects of the environment but not the
**	query being run, this routine assumes that the environ-
**	ment is ok, and checks that if it applies to this tuple.
**
**	Two things are checked.  The first is if this tuple applies
**	to the operation in question (passed as 'inbit').  The
**	second is if the set of domains in the tuple contains the
**	set of domains in the query.  If either of these fail,
**	the return is zero.  Otherwise the return is the operation
**	bit.  In otherwise, the return is the operation to which
**	this tuple applies (if any).
**
**	As a special check, the domain set is checked for all
**	zero.  If so, no domains have been referenced for this
**	operation at all, and we return zero.  In other words, this
**	tuple might apply to this operation, but since we don't
**	use the operation anyhow we will ignore it.  It is important
**	to handle things in this way so that the qualification for
**	this tuple doesn't get appended if the variable is not
**	used in a particular context.
**
**	Parameters:
**		inbit -- the bit describing the operation to be
**			checked.  Note that only one bit should
**			be set in this word, although this is
**			not checked.
**		domset -- the set of domains actually referenced
**			in this query for the operation described
**			by 'inbit'.
**		protup -- the tuple in question.
**
**	Returns:
**		The operation (if any) to which this tuple applies.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		none
**
**	Called By:
**		protect() -- in four places.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		55
