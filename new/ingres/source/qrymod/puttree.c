/*
**  PUTTREE -- put tree into 'tree' catalog
**
**	The named tree is inserted into the 'tree' catalog.
**
**	The algorithm is to lock up the entire catalog and try to
**	find the smallest unique id possible for the named relation.
**
**	Parameters:
**		root -- the root of the tree to insert.
**		treerelid -- the relid of the relation for which
**			this tree applies.
**		treeowner -- the owner of the above relation.
**		treetype -- the type of this tree; uses the mdXXX
**			type (as mdPROT, mdINTEG, mdDISTR, etc.).
**
**	Returns:
**		The treeid that was assigned to this tree.
**
**	Side Effects:
**		The tree catalog gets locked, and information is
**		inserted.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		10

/*
**  RELNTRWR -- physical tree write to relation
**
**	This is the routine called from writeqry to write trees
**	to the 'tree' relation (rather than the W_down pipe).
**
**	It is assumed that the (treerelid, treeowner, treetype,
**	treeid) combination is unique in the tree catalog, and that
**	the tree catalog is locked.
**
**	Parameters:
**		ptr -- a pointer to the data.  If NULL, this is
**			a control call.
**		len -- the length of the data.  If ptr == NULL, this
**			field is a control code:  zero means
**			initialize (thus taking the next two param-
**			eters); one means flush.
**		treerelid -- the name of the relation for which this
**			tree applies (init only).
**		treeowner -- the owner of this relation (init only).
**		treetype -- on initialization, this tells what the
**			tree is used for.
**		treeid -- on initialization, this is the tree id we
**			want to use.
**
**	Returns:
**		The number of bytes written ('len').
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Well, yes.  Activity occurs in the tree catalog.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		none
