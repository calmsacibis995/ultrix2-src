/*
**  SUBSVARS -- scan query tree and replace VAR nodes
**
**	Scans a tree and finds all VAR nodes for this variable.
**	These nodes are looked up in the translation tree and
**	replaced by the value found there.  If this is for a
**	view, the corresponding node must exist in the translation
**	tree, otherwise, a 'zero' node (of a type appropriate based
**	on the context) is created and inserted.
**
**	This routine is one half of the guts of the whole view
**	algorithm.
**
**	VAR nodes are detached and replaced with the replacement
**	as defined by the view.  Note that there can never be any
**	problems here, since VAR nodes are only used in retrieve
**	contexts.
**
**	It does some extra processing with RESDOM nodes with
**	resno = 0.  These nodes specify a 'tid' domain, and are
**	included by the parser on REPLACE and DELETE commands
**	(for some reason decomp wants them).  Subsvars will allow
**	this construct iff the right hand pointer is a VAR node
**	with attno = 0.  In this case it just changes the varno
**	of the VAR node to be the Qt.qt_resvar number.  This is be-
**	cause the Qt.qt_resvar is the variable number of the one and
**	only underlying base relation of the view on an update
**	(which is presumably the only case where this can come
**	up).  Vrscan has already insured that there can only be
**	a single base relation in this case.
**
**	This whole messy thing is only done with view substitutions.
**
**	Parameters:
**		proot -- a pointer to the pointer to the root of the
**			tree to be updated.
**		vn -- the varno of the view variable.  This is the
**			varno which will be scanned for.
**		transtree -- a pointer to the left branch (target list)
**			of the translation tree.
**		vmode -- mdVIEW if called from view processor, mdAPP
**			if called from the integrity processor with
**			an APPEND command, else something else.
**			Mostly, changes the handling of TID type
**			nodes, and forces an error on a view if the
**			VAR node in the scanned tree does not exist
**			in the vtree.
**
**	Returns:
**		none
**		(non-local on error).
**
**	Side Effects:
**		The tree pointed to by *proot is updated in possibly
**			very exciting ways.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		32
