**	Enters all text gotten through getch() [getch.c]

**	eat_display() assumes that when it is called a 
**	"left_ch" has just been seen. It will "eat" up to 
**	MAXSTRING characters.
**	Newline is played with because :
**		a) a newline may have been read by eat_display
**		   instead of yylex(), therefore if eat_display
**		   stops there, yylex() must know that a newline
**		   has just been seen and it must test for C_CODE.
**		b) Newline may have to be set to 0 if an include()
**		   was done which sets it to 1, and no yylex() was
**		   done afterwards to reset it.
**
**		NOTE : This playing with Newline is needed because 
**		yylex() and not getch() maintains Newline. If getch()
**		maintained Newline then it would be automatically right.
**
**	Parameters:
**		disp -- display to add elements to if != 0 else
**			characters are written out.
**		left_ch -- left delimiter character
**		right_ch -- right delimiter character
**
**	Side Effects:
**		advances input to after the close of the
**		left_ch, right_ch pair.
**		may back up 2 characters.
**
**	Called By:
**		semantic routines dealing with array subscription
**
**	Bugs:
**		#include's encountered, are treated wrongly
**		because the "#include ...c.h" is put out immediately,
**		while the display is put out only later.
