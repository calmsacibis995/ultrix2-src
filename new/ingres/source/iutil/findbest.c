/*
**	Findbest - find the "best" place to put a tuple.
**	Findbest does not actually put the tuple but rather
**	returns and allocates the tid for the tuple.
**
**	The initial part of the algorithm depends on whether
**	the relation is a heap or not.
**
**	If the relation is a heap, if there is a current page
**	with room for the tuple, that page is used. Otherwise
**	the last page of the heap is considered.
**
**	If the relation is hash or isam, then "find" is used
**	to determine the primary page for the tuple.
**
**	If necessary, findbest will allocate an overflow page
**	if there is not sufficient room for the tuple otherwise.
**
**	If checkdups is TRUE and the relation is not a heap,
**	findbest will check for duplicates.
**
**	Returns:
**
**		0 tuple not a duplicate, tid allocated
**		1 tuple a duplicate of the tuple at tid
