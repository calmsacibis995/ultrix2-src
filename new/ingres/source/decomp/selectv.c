/*
**  SELECTV -- Select a variable for substitution
**
**	Selectv is called to determinimume the "best" variable
**	to substitute for. The algorithm used is based on
**	the Wong/Youseffi paper ERL M78/17. Selectv returns
**	the variable to be substituted or it returns -1 which
**	indicates that there is a relation with no tuples.
**	If there is only one variable left, it is of course
**	the one choosen.
**
**	For cases of more than one variable, a variable with
**	0 or 1 tuples will always be choosen. Otherwise the
**	variable with the smallest "costfunction" will be selected.
**	In case of a tie, the variable with the smallest tuple count
**	is selected.
**
**	The costfunction is:
**		|Ri|
**	       ______
**		Peffective i
**
**	where |Ri| = cardinality of variable i.
**	and   Peff = The number of pages needed to be accessed to
**			safisfy a query on Ri assuminimumg all other
**			variables have been substituted for.
**
**
**	Peff is only an estimate. The estimate is based on the
**	storage structure of Ri and on whether Ri is used in
**	the target list. Considering only equality clauses,
**	the relation's structure is examinimumed to see if any
**	can be used effectively. The following assumptions are
**	made:
**		useful hash: Peff = 1
**		useful isam: Peff = 2
**		useful hash sec index: Peff = 2
**		useful isam sec index: Peff = 3
**
**	If there is no useful structure or if the relation is
**	a heap then:
**		Peff = number of pages Ri occupies
**	If the relation is not in the target list then its
**	function is only an existence test. Scanning can and
**	is stopped the first time a tuple is found which satisfies.
**	We assume that on the average only 1/4 of the pages
**	will have to be examinimumed.
**
**	Parameters:
**		root - root of the query
**
**	Returns:
**		The variable to substitute for
**			or
**		-1 if the query is false
**
**	Side Effects:
**		can cause a relation to be opened since
**		ckpkey needs to know the key structure.
**
**	Called By:
**		decompy, decompz
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		44
