** DECISION -- This file contains code related to deciding how to

**	and the other routines are called only by decision. The routine
**	in this file include:
**
**	Decision -- Decides how to process a query.
**
**	Fixtl     -- Determines the target list for each component.
**
**	Fixresult -- Determines the result relation for the next query
**
**	Fixrange  -- Adjust the range table after a query
**
**	Fixovlap  -- Fixes trees in cases where reduction is used
**
**	Rmovlap   -- Restores trees in cases where reduction was used.
**
**	Listcomp  -- Debugging routine.
*/
/*
**	Decision is given a subquery and decides how to process it.
**	The choices are:
**		Disjoint pieces -- The original query had disjoint components.
**					Do each component separately.
**		Reduction       -- The query is joined by a single variable.
**					Reduce the query on that joining variable
**					and do each component separately.
**		Substitution    -- The query is neither disjoint nor reducible.
**					Process by tuple substitution.
**
**	Notice that decision() is recursive and will call itself on each
**	subcomponent it decides to do. Decision calls various support
**	routines in the file "reduction.c".
