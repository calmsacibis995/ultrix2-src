**

**		field (0 to 255 bytes), "value" is variable length and
**		holds the actual value (if len != 0) of the node.
**		The "value" is one of the types contained in "union symvalue".
**
**		On a thirty-two bit machine, there are two bytes of padding
**		after type and length.  These two bytes are discarded 
**		when a symbol is written to a pipe.

**	QUERYTREE NODE
**
**		Basic node in the querytree. Each node has a left and
**		right descendent. If the node is a leaf node then the
**		left and right pointers will be NULL. Depending on the
**		"type" field of the symbol structure, there may be additional
**		information.

/*
**	SUNDRY CONSTANTS
**
**		There are several differences in the handling of data
**		structures on 16 and 32 bit machines:
**			1).  A pointer to  memory is either 2 or 4 bytes.
**			2).  Padding is inserted in structures to insure
**				alignment of 16 and 32 bit numbers.
**
**		For these reasons the following constant definitions
**		are useful for machine independent allocation.
**
**		These are based on the PDP11 compile flag.
**
**		QT_HDR_SIZ -- size of left and right pointers, typ,
**			len and padding
**		SYM_HDR_SIZ -- size of type and len in symbol
**			structure -- includes any padding before
**			the value field
**		TYP_LEN_SIZ -- size of type and len in symbol
**			structure -- without padding
**
**		INGRES FOLKS: don't change these back to sizeof's!!!
**			      The PDP-11 compiler doesn't understand!
