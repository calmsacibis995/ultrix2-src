/*
**  PB_READ -- read a pipe block
**
**	This routine reads a pipe block into *ppb.  It also handles
**	all the low level protocol: RESET blocks, SYNC blocks, META
**	blocks, blocks intended for another process, etc.
**
**	When this routine returns, it returns with a block intended
**	for this process, which must be a REGULAR block, a RESPONSE
**	block, or an ERROR block.
**
**	Parameters:
**		ppb -- a pointer to the area which wants the block.
**
**	Returns:
**		none
**
**	Side Effects:
**		ppb is set to the named block.
**		Virtually any amount of stuff can happen, depending
**			on what is coming through the pipe.
**
**	Trace Flags:
**		12.4 - 12.9
