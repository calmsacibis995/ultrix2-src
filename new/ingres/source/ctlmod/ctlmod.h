**  CTLMOD.H -- control module header file
**
**	This header file defines all the internal data structures
**	used by the control module.
**
**	If something other than the control module or the initializer
**	has to include this, something is wrong!
**
**	Compilation Flags:
**		xCM_DEBUG -- if set, certain code is compiled in that
**			does consistancy checks on the data structures
**			at opportune times.
**		xMONITOR -- if set, turns on performance evaluation
**			code.
**		xCTR1, xCTR2, xCTR3 -- if set, turns on various levels
**			of trace information.  These must be properly
**			nested; if xCTR2 is set, xCTR1 *MUST* be set.

**	allocated off the stack.

**	Some of the fields describe the NEXT block in the sequence.

**	Ctx_cmark is useful ONLY when this block is not currently
