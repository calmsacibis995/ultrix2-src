In order to run ingres, you must setup an ingres account.  You can
setup the account so that its login directory is here or somewhere else.
If the login directory is to be somewhere else, do the following:

	- Setup the account.
	- Create the the login directory.
	- Then do:  cp -r . ~ingres

After the account has been setup, you can then use ~ingres/Makefile to
install the necessary images and libraries in the appropriate
system directories, as in:

	(cd ~ingres; make )

This will install images in /usr/new and libraries in /usr/lib.  These 
defaults can be changed by redefining BIN and/or LIB on the make command 
line, as in:

	(cd ~ingres; make BIN=/bin)

There is more documentation in the doc subdirectory.
