Notes on the Icon ``Tour'' (TR 81-11a)
.ft R

.PP
A technical report, TR 81-11a, describing the implementation of Icon, is
enclosed with Release 5g.
This report is based on the original Version 5 implementation done for the
PDP-11.
While most of the information in this report is machine independent,
the machine dependent sections refer to the PDP-11.
A new report is in preparation and will be available at some
point in the future.

One important difference related to external functions should be noted.
Since the 4.1bsd C compiler does not initialize unions,
procedure blocks for external functions must be declared and
initialized using the \fBb_iproc\fR structure rather than the \fBb_proc\fR
structure as shown in TR 81-11a. (Procedure blocks are declared after
the body of the function.)  The \fBb_iproc\fR structure is identical to the
\fBb_proc\fR structure except that it uses the \fBsdescrip\fR structure rather
than the \fBdescrip\fR structure (\fBdescrip\fR has a union, \fBsdescrip\fR
does not) to hold the name of the procedure.  The \fBb_iproc\fR structure
should only be used for declaration and initialization of data blocks
for functions.
