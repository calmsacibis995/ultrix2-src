Each of the sample Icon programs in this directory has a corresponding
test data file with the suffix .dat.  All the sample programs
take data from standard input.  For example, rsg.icn may be run by

	icont rsg.icn -x <rsg.dat

All the samples can be translated and run by typing:

	DoSamps <system>

where <system> is the Icon system to use, e.g. "DoSamps icont"

The files Results.it and Results.ic contain the expected output
of DoSamps for icont and iconc respectively.  The compilation
statistics may differ from those in Results depending on the
machine on which Icon is running.

Note:  Do not run DoSamps for both icont and iconc concurrently
as the systems will overwrite each others output files.
