Description:

Icon is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is
well-suited for nonnumerical applications.  Icon supports several data
types, including variable-length strings, lists with flexible access
methods, and tables with associative lookup. Storage management is
automatic.  Icon has a goal-directed evaluation mechanism that allows
concise solutions of many programming tasks to be formulated easily.
Its string scanning facility is comparable to pattern matching in
SNOBOL4, but Icon allows all language operations to be used in the
analysis and synthesis of strings.  With its high-level facilities and
emphasis on string and list processing, Icon fills a gap in the UNIX
language hierarchy.

The design and implementation of Icon was supported, in part, by
the National Science Foundation under grants MCS75-01397,
MCS79-03890, and MCS81-01916.

Installation:

Be warned, the int and cmp directories share a lot of source files
through links. So if you are copying this directory, use tar
instead of cp.

If you wish to change where the various lib files and iconx reside,
you must rerun int/bin/icon-setup with suitable arguments. See
docs/install and ./config for details.
