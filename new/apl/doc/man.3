.NH 1
Automatic Workspace Loading
.PP
\*u \*a has the nice feature that
you can automatically load a workspace file
into the internal workspace when you start \*a.
Instead of using the command:
.sp
$ apl   <or>    $ apl \-m
.sp
and then loading the workspace you want
with the system command:
.sp
	)load workspace
.sp
you can say:
.sp
$ apl workspace    <or>     $ apl \-m workspace
.sp
\*a will be started,
and will automatically look for
and load the file ``workspace''.
.PP
As an additional convenience,
\*a will automatically load a file
named ``continue'' if it exists.
Thus,
if you wish to use
the file ``continue'' as your initial
workspace,
you need only type:
.sp
$ apl   <or>    $ apl \-m
.sp
.PP
The system command ``)continue''
facilitates use of this handy
automatic loading feature,
providing a convenient method of
terminating an \*a session
and restarting it at some later
time with a minimum of effort.
You may,
for instance,
end your \*a session with:
.sp
	)continue
.sp
which will save your workspace in a file
named ``continue'' and terminate \*a.
To resume your work at some later time,
type the shell command:
.sp
$ apl	<or>	$ apl \-m
.sp
(Recall that if you don't have
a file named ``continue''
when you type this,
\*a starts with ``clear ws''.)
.NH 1
Workspace Library
.PP
When you specify a workspace to be loaded,
\*a will first look in your directory.
If it finds the workspace,
it will load it.
If not,
it will look in the library directory:
/usr/lib/apl.
Thus,
if you do not have a file named ``news''
and you type:
.sp
$ apl news
.sp
\*a will be started,
will see that you don't have
a ``news'' file,
and will print:
.sp
[using /usr/lib/apl/news]
.sp
Equivalently,
if you are in \*a and you type:
.sp
	)load news      <or>    )copy news
.sp
you will get the library file
if you don't have a file named ``news''.
If the workspace you specify
does not exist in either your
directory or in /usr/lib/apl,
an error message will be printed.
