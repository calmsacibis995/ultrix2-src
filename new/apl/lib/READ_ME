These files are in VAX APL workspace format.  To use them on a
PDP-11 you'll need to convert them with "aplcvt" (the source
program is in the parent of this directory).  The command
"aplcvt *" will suffice (it will complain about this file and
the directory "fn", but that is of no consequence).  The converted
files will have a ".pdp" extension

The files in the subdirectory "fn" are in ASCII format and can be
read into APL with the ")read" command.

APL will automatically search for a file in "/usr/lib/apl" if it
doesn't find it in the current directory.  Thus, it is convenient
to put these workspaces (and/or your own library workspaces) into
"/usr/lib/apl".  (If this pathname isn't convenient, you can redefine
it [file a0.c]).
