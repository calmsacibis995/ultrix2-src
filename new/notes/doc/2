The notesfile system is invoked with a single command line.
Most notesfile commands require only a single character (like the vi editor).
Those that do require more than one character are terminated by a carriage
return.
.NH 2
Invocation
.XS
\*(SN Invocation
.XE
.PP
Invoke the notesfile system with:
.DS
notes [ \-sxi ] [ \-t termtype ] [ \-f nfile ] [ topic1 ] [ topic2 ... ]
.DE
The topic list (e.g., topic1) specifies the notesfiles to read.
Invoking the notes system with NO arguments causes the program to
look for a file called `.notesrc' in your home directory, and
if it exists, effectively does `notes \-f ~/.notesrc'.
When more than one topic is specified, the user encounters each topic
sequentially (i.e., topic2 is entered upon completion of topic1).
.PP
The
.B \-s
switch activates the "notesfile sequencer" which is discussed
in section 2.7.  Specify
.B \-x
to use the extended sequencer.
The
.B \-i
flag selects yet another sequencing mode.
.PP
The
.B \-t
option directs the notesfile system to use \fItermtype\fP as the user's
terminal type, overriding the TERM shell variable.
.PP
The
.B \-f
option directs the notesfile system to read the contents
of the file "nfile" for a list of notesfiles to read.

.B \-f
Option)
for more information on the format of this file.

.XE

The notesfile system supports pattern matching for names in
the same manner as the shell.
By using the shell meta-characters "*", "?", "[" and "]", the user
can specify a number of notesfiles with a single entry.
To read all the notesfiles that pertain to
.UX
enter the following
line (the quotes are required to protect the asterisks from interpretation
by the shell):
.DS
	notes "*unix*"
.DE
There are several ways to read the notesfiles
test1, test2, test3 and test4:
.DS
	notes test1 test2 test3 test4

	notes "test?"

	notes "test[1234]"
.DE
This feature is available from the normal entry (notes) and the
automatic sequencer entry (see section 2.7);
it is also available to the network transmission
and statistics programs.
.NH 2
The \-f Option
.XS
\*(SN The \-f Option
.XE
.PP
The
.B \-f
option of the notesfile system
specifies a file of notesfile names to read.
The file consists of lines containing notesfile names:
.DS
nfgripes
net.unix-wizards
net.bob*
net.general
fa.telecom
ucbcad.*
!ucbcad.test
!net.bob
.DE
The names start at the left margin; they are indented here
for readibility.
The sequencer mode can be changed
by inserting a line of the form:
.DS
\-s
.DE
Again, this starts at the left margin.
The "s" can be any of: "s", "x", "i", or "n".
When a line of this form is read from the file, the sequencer mode
is set to the corresponding mode: The normal \fBs\fPequencer,
the e\fBx\fPtended sequencer,
the \fBi\fPndex sequencer,
and
\fBn\fPo sequencer.
.PP
To always enter nfgripes, micronotes, and bicycle
while only entering the networked notesfiles "net.*" when new notes
are present, one might use "notes \-f myfile"
with the following "myfile":

Almost all notesfile commands require exactly one character

require a terminating carriage return (currently, choosing a note to read
is the only non-single character command).

The commands were chosen to be easy to remember.
Upper case forms of commands usually function
like their lower case counterparts but with some additional
feature or power (i.e., "w" writes a response, "W" includes the current

Does anyone have any insight about the relative speeds of the Winchester
disks available on these systems?  The previous disk seems to have
track to track response times commensurate with reasonably fast 8"

will not meet reasonable specifications for response time for these

Most users prefer to scan notesfiles and see only those notes written
since their last reading.
The notesfile "sequencer" provides this capability.
It is activated by the
.B \-s
option ("sequencer") on the
command line.
When the sequencer is activated, the notesfile system automatically remembers
the last time the user read notes in each notesfile.
Subsequent entries to the
notesfile can use the "last time" information to show only new notes and
responses.
If there is nothing new in a notesfile, 
the sequencer proceeds to the next notesfile specified in the command line.
.PP
The normal sequencer does not give the user a chance to read
the notesfile if there are no new notes or responses;
sometimes it is desirable to be able to do so.
Use the
.B \-x
option to enable the sequencer and enter the  notesfile 
even if there are no new notes.
.PP
No keys need be pressed if there are no new notes in the entire list
and the normal (
.B \-s
) sequencer mode is selected.
With the extended (
.B \-x
) sequencer,
the user must type "q", "Q", or control-d
for each notesfile regardless of whether
there are new notes.
.PP
The
.B \-i
mode of sequencing is similar to the

Using the

The user is placed on the index page of notesfiles which contain new
notesfiles.
.NH 3
Seeing New Notes and Responses
.XS
\*(SN Seeing New Notes and Responses
.XE
.PP
The sequencer always shows the base note of a
modified note string,
whether or not is has been shown before,
in order to establish the context of the new response(s).
The "j" command skips to the next modified text (note or response).
.PP
If the rest of a particular note string seems uninteresting,
skip to the next modified note string with the "J" ("big Jump")
command.
This skips any new responses on the current note string.
It is common to follow in detail only a few note strings and
skip others with the "J" command.
.PP
When no more new notes or responses exist, both the 
"j" and "J" commands will take the user to the index page.
.PP
Two other commands useful with the sequencer are "l" and
"L".  "l" works much like "j" in that only modified note strings
are displayed.  However unlike "j", "l" will display all continuation
pages of the note before proceeding to the next note string.
Also, upon visiting the last page of the last modified note string,
"l" will cause an exit with update.  "L", analogous to "J",
jumps to the next modified base note or exits if there are no
new notes.
.PP
To modify the "last entry" time (used for searches),
use the "o" ("oldest notes to read")
command.
This command modifies the "last entry" time for the current notesfile.
The "o", "j", and "J" commands 
function whether the sequencer is on or off
but never change the sequencer's memory of the last entry time.
When the sequencer is off, the "last entry" time is set to January 1,
1970.
.PP
To exit the notesfile, use the "q" command.
Exiting with "q" will update the user's
"last entry" time.
Exiting with capital "Q" will NOT modify the 
"last entry" time
(neither will control-D).
Another possibility is to exit with "z".  This
forces an immediate exit like control-D but in
addition updates the sequencing information.
.NH 3
Automatic Sequencing
.XS
\*(SN Automatic Sequencing

allows the user to invoke notes with the sequencer enabled and a list

	autoseq
.DE
This is equivalent to typing "notes \-s" or using the "\-s" sequencing
mode; the user only enters notesfiles which have new text.
By typing "\-x" or "\-i" on the command line, the user can
specify other sequencing modes as well.
.NH 2
Environment Variables
.XS

The notesfile program reads several environment variables to
tailor the system to the user's preferences.
Below is a list of the variables,
their purpose, and their default values.
.LP
NFED
.IP
specifies which editor will be invoked when the user writes a
note or response. 
If this variable is not specified, the notesfile system looks for
the environment variable "EDITOR" (which many other programs use).
If neither "NFED" nor "EDITOR" are defined, a default editor is
used (/bin/ed).
.LP
PAGER
.IP
is the paging program ("more", "pg") which is used for scrolling
the help files.
The default paging program is /usr/ucb/more.
.LP
MAILER
.IP

to /usr/ucb/mail.
.LP
