This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.
Last updated March 25, 1986.

Systems:
  For each type of system, the name of the appropriate s- header file
  is given.

Berkeley 4.1 (s-bsd4.1.h)

  Works on vaxes.

Berkeley 4.2 (s-bsd4.2.h)

  Works on several machines.

Berkeley 4.3 (s-bsd4.3.h)

  Works, on Vaxes at least.

Ultrix

  This is another name for Berkeley 4.2.

Uniplus 5.2 (s-unipl5.2.h)

  Works, on Dual machines at least.

VMS

  A port for this system is in distribution on the
  Internet, but the changes have not been merged
  into this Emacs distribution yet.

System V rel 0 (s-usg5.0.h)

  Works, on Vaxes.

System V rel 2 (s-usg5.2.h)

  Works on various machines.
  On some (maybe all) machines the library -lPW exists and contains
  a version of `alloca'.  On these machines, to use it, put
     #define HAVE_ALLOCA
     #define LIB_STANDARD -lPW -lc
  in the m-...h file for the machine.

  If you find that the character Meta-DEL makes Emacs crash,
  find where function init_sys_modes in sysdep.c sets sg.c_cc[VQUIT]
  and make it store 7 there.  I have as yet no evidence of whether
  this problem, known in HP-UX, exists in other system V versions.

System V rel 2.2 (s-usg5.2.2.h)

  In 5.2.2 AT&T undid, incompatibly, their previous incompatible
  change to the way the nlist library is called.  A different s- file
  is used to enable the other interface.

  They call themselves the right choice--can't they choose?


Machines:
  For each type of machine, the names of the m- and s- header files
  are given.

Apollo running Domain (m-apollo.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Works, but it is impossible to dump Emacs; the standard
  Lisp code must be loaded each time Emacs is started.  This
  is a limitation of their operating system.  In other respects
  the system appears to be Berkeley 4.2, and Emacs is told that
  it is running under 4.2.

AT&T 7300 (m-7300.h; s-usg5.0.h? not sure)

  Changes merged as of 17.57.  You may have to change
  the CPP= line to cc -E, in src/Makefile.

Celerity (m-celerity.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Works, as of 17.56.

Dual running System V (m-dual.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  As of 17.46, this works except for a few changes
  needed in unexec.c.

Dual running Uniplus (m-dual.h; s-unipl5.2.h)

  Works, as of 17.51.

Encore machine (m-ns16000.h; s-umax4.2.h)

  This machine bizarrely uses 4.2BSD modified to use the COFF format
  for object files.  Works (as of 17.52).

Gould

  A port has been done but has not been merged into this
  distribution version.

HP 9000s300 (m-hp200.h; s-hpux.h)

  Works as of 17.52.  This machine is a 68020.
  There are at least three kinds of "HP9000" that are really
  completely different computers.  The one called "series 500"
  uses a seriously incompatible memory architecture and it
  is not supported.  Supporting it would require solving
  difficult problems.

Masscomp

  An attempt was made but it encountered too many compiler bugs.

Megatest (m-mega68.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Emacs 15 worked; do not have any reports about Emacs 16 or 17
  but any new bugs are probably not difficult.

NCR Tower 32 (m-tower32.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Nu (TI or LMI) (m-nu.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  Nearly working; a few bugs remain.

Plexus (m-plexus.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Pyramid (m-pyramid.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  In Pyramid system 2.5 there has been a compiler bug making
  Emacs crash just after screen-splitting with Qnil containing 0.
  A compiler that fixes this is Pyramid customer number 8494,
  internal number 1923.

  Some versions of the pyramid compiler get fatal
  errors when the -gx compiler switch is used; if this
  happens to you, change src/ymakefile to remove that switch.

Sequent Balance (m-sequent.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Emacs 17.52 works in their system version 2.0.
  Emacs has not been tried on their system version 1.3.

Stride (m-stride.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  Works (most recent news for 17.54).
  Note, however, that this was on a Unix version not
  yet released by Stride.  It is probably also possible
  to run on Stride's 5.1 system but changes in the s- file
  are probably needed.

Sun (m-sun.h, m-sun2.h, m-sun3.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  There are three m- files for different models of Sun.
  All use Berkeley 4.2.  Emacs 17 has run on all of them.

Tahoe (m-tahoe.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Works, as of an early version 17.

Tektronix(?) 16000 box (m-16000.h; s-bsd4.2.h)

  Emacs 15 worked; no reports since then.

Vax running Berkeley Unix (m-vax.h; s-bsd4.1.h or s-bsd4.2.h or s-bsd4.3.h)

  Works.  Note that "ultrix" is essentially 4.2; use s-bsd4.2.h.

Vax running System V rel 2 (m-vax.h; s-usg5.2.h)

  17.53 is believed to fix the problems previously known.

Vax running System V rel 0 (m-vax.h; s-usg5.0.h)

  Works as of 17.56.

Vax running VMS

  Preliminary port completed; merging to be done soon.
