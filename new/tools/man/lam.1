.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lam
copies the named files side by side onto the standard output.
Input lines from each
.I file
become fragments which are assembled into long output lines.
The name `\fB\-\fP' means the standard input, and may be repeated.
.PP
Normally, each option affects only the
.I file
after it.
If the option letter is capitalized it affects all subsequent files
until it appears again uncapitalized.
The options are described below.
.IP \fB\-f\fP\ min.max
Print line fragments according to
.IR min.max ,
where
.I min
is the minimum field width and
.I max
the maximum field width.
If
.I min
begins with a zero, zeros will be added to make up the field width,
and if it begins with a `\-', the fragment will be left-adjusted
within the field.
.IP \fB\-p\fP\ min.max
Like \fB\-f\fP,
but pad this file's field when end-of-file is reached
and other files are still active.
.IP \fB\-s\fP\ sepstring
Print
.I sepstring
before printing line fragments from the next file.
This option may appear after the last file.
.PP
To print files simultaneously for easy viewing use
.IR pr (1).
