If a topic name is typed in reply,
.I phelp
will print a page of information and then wait until a space is typed
before it continues.
.PP
.I "Command line topics"
.PP
Information on a specific
.I topic
can be requested by giving the
.I phelp
command with the topic name as an argument on the command line.
If the last argument is
.B index,
the subtopics corresponding to the previous argument are listed.
Provided the information has not been redirected to a file,
.I phelp
will prompt for further commands once it has finished printing.
.PP
.B "Creating topics"
.PP
Project help files reside in the `help' directory located in the project
root directory. Subtopics are contained in subdirectories. A
subtopic directory has the same name as a help file but with a `.d'
suffix. For example, if ``bugfixes'' is a subtopic of ``news'', it will be
found in the directory `news.d', which itself is a subdirectory of the
project `help' directory.
.PP
Subtopics can be nested to any level.
.PP
Any filename beginning with a `.' is ignored by
.I phelp.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-P \fIprojectname\fR"
