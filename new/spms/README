Description:

The Software Project Management System (SPMS) is a system for the
management of medium- to large-scale software systems. SPMS provides,
within the UNIX environment, a number of commands which can greatly
simplify many tasks associated with program development and
maintenance. SPMS does not attempt to duplicate existing UNIX program
development tools such as make or SCCS, but instead provides a way of
coordinating these tools.  SPMS can be fitted to existing software
systems. It retains the full capabilities of the UNIX environment with
unrestricted access to UNIX tools. As a result, software packages
developed using SPMS do not depend on the system for their survival and
can be ported to versions of UNIX that do not support SPMS.

Installation:

1.	Set up directories `/usr/new', `/usr/new/lib', and
	`/usr/man/mann. These must be writeable by the installing
	process. If you want to put SPMS somewhere else, you will
	have to change the `DEST=' macro in all the makefiles, and
	edit the `spms.h' file in spms/include.

2.	Change to the spms/bin directory and execute `pinstall'.
	`pinstall' MUST be executed from this directory. If something
	goes wrong, don't panic. Just fix the problem and restart
	`pinstall'
