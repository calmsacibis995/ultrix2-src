Description:

Dsh works in two phases; bidding and execution.  The bidding is performed by
starting a dbid program on all the requested machines (using rsh).  The
dbid's send back bids using the ipc.  The dsh command then picks some
subset of the bidding machines and runs the requested command on them,
once again using rsh.

How to make it:

To make the distributed shell system perform the following:
    1) make dsh - this is the program that the user uses to distribute
	his programs.  See the man page for dsh.
    2) make dbid - this program must be on every system which can have
	user programs distributed to it.  It must be in the search path
	of each user who wishs to use dsh. It is used by dsh to create
	a bid on a particular system.
    3) create a dshrc file - this is the default rc file for dsh.  It must
	reside in /usr/lib.  It specifies the systems to attempt to
	receive bids from.  Users may override this file by creating
	.dshrc files in their home directories.
