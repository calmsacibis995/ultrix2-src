#
# This file contains descriptions of different types of modems.
# These decriptions are used by tip(1c) & uucp(1c) if each is
# compiled to include the generic dialer modem support. See
# acucap(5) for additional information. To get a match the name
# field must match the correct field in /etc/remote (`at' field for
# tip) or in /usr/lib/uucp/L-devices (`Brand name' or `5th field' for uucp).
# If no match is found the `old' method of dialing will be used.
#
#
#  Use the 'si' boolean if using a DMF32 type interface (an interface
#      which does not return any characters until carrier is detected).
#      Use of this flag means to blindly dial the modem and wait for
#      carrier, without looking for any return codes or strings from the
#      modem.
#
#  Info for writing new entries is at the end of this file.

#  NOTE: If you edit this file to add additional entries, notice that
#	the continuation lines are indented in addition to the previous
#	line ending with "\".  This convention must be obeyed for the
#	entry to work.  Also, be aware that if you specify 'ls' to get
#	a faster sleep routine (1/1000000's of a second) for the delays,
#	the "fd" (or full delay for carrier) is STILL specified in
#	seconds. The fast sleep routine is only used for the "sd", "dd",
#	"da", and "cd" delays.
#	In addition, you may now imbed one second delays directly in
#	the strings with "\d".  See the hayes entries for an example.
#
#
#
# Options used in this capabilities file are:
#
#      Strings which can be written to a modem:
#
# ss = Synchronization string. Initially output to modem to 'see' if its awake.
# sr = What modem should say to ss having been sent.
# di = Dial initialization string (ie start a dialing sequence).
# dt = How to finish a dial sequence (needed since some modems need
#      to put the number to be dialed between some string).
# dr = What modem should say if the dial went off correctly.
# cs = Completion string which is a catchall for sync/dial strings
#      (Sent out last but probably not used by many modems).
# ab = An abort string to be send to modem if we abort tip.
# ds = A sequence used when modem is disconnected.
# os = A string which says a remote system came online (after 
#      carrier is detected).
# rs = A single character replacement string for the default delay
#      character of '=' OR '-' (which is default for DEC equipment). This
#      conversion only takes place within the phone number string
#      passed in.
#
#      Logical flags:
#
# cr = Wait for carrier to be sensed.
# hu = hangup if line goes away.
# re = Reset dtr (turn it off then on) before dialing begins.
# ls = use local sleep routine (rather than sleep) & thus all delays
#      must be given in microseconds (1000000 apx eq 1 second).
# si = ignore all response strings as this modem is attached to 
#	an interface which gives no characters back until carrier
#	is up (eg a dmf32).
#
#      Delays:
#
# sd = Synchronization delay (time between sync characters).
# dd = Dial delay (time between dial chars).
# da = Dial acknowledge delay (time to wait before looking for dial response)
# cd = Completion delay (time between completion chars).
# fd = Full delay (total time we wait for carrier detect).
#
#	Debug:
#
# db = Print info useful for debugging new entries.
