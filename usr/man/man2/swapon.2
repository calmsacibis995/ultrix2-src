.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN swapon
system call
makes the block device 
.I special 
available to the system for
allocation for paging and swapping.  The names of potentially
available devices are known to the system and defined at system
configuration time.  The size of the swap area on 
.I special 
is calculated at the time the device is first made available
for swapping.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack may be
dismounted.
