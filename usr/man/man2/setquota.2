.TH setquota 2
.SH NAME
setquota \- enable/disable quotas on a file system
.SH SYNTAX
.nf
.B setquota(special, file)
.B char *special, *file;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Disc quotas are enabled or disabled with the
.PN setquota
call.  The
.I special
indicates a block special device on which a
mounted file system exists.
If
.I file
is nonzero, it specifies a file in that
file system from which to take the quotas.  If
.I file
is 0, then quotas are disabled on the file system.
The quota file must exist; it is normally created with the
quotacheck(8) program.
.PP
Only the super-user may turn quotas on or off.
.PP
A 0 return value indicates a successful call.  A value
of \-1 is returned when an error occurs and 
.I errno
is set to indicate the reason for failure.
