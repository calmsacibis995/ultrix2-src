.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN setpgrp
system call
sets the process group of the specified process
.I pid
to the specified
.IR pgrp .
If
.I pid
is zero, then the call applies to the current process.
.PP
If the invoker is not the super-user, then the affected process
must have the same effective user-id as the invoker or be a descendant
of the invoking process.

returns when the operation was successful.  If
the request failed, \-1 is returned and the global

.PN setpgrp
is called with no arguments and
the new process group id is returned if successful.

will fail and the process group will not be altered if
