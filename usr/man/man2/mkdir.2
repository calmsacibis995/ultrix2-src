.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.PN mkdir
system call creates a new directory file with name
.IR path .
The mode of the new file
is initialized from
.IR mode .
The protection part of the mode
is modified by the process's mode mask.  For further information, see
umask(2).
.PP
The directory's owner ID is set to the process's effective user ID.
The directory's group ID is set to that of the parent directory in
which it is created.
.PP
The low-order 9 bits of mode are modified by the process's
file mode creation mask: all bits set in the process's file mode
creation mask are cleared.  For further information, see umask(2).
.PP
A 0 return value indicates success.  A \-1 return value
indicates an error, and an error code is stored in
.I errno.
