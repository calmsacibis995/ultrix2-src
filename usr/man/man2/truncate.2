.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN truncate
system call causes the file named by
.I path
or referenced by
.I fd
to be truncated to at most
.I length
bytes in size.  If the file previously
was larger than this size, the extra data
is lost.
With
.PN ftruncate,
the file must be open for writing.
.PP
A value of 0 is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call
fails a \-1 is returned, and the global variable \fIerrno\fP
specifies the error.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Partial blocks discarded as the result of truncation
are not zero filled; this can result in holes in files
which do not read as zero.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
