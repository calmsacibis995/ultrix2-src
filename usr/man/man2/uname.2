.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN uname
system call stores information identifying the current ULTRIX
system in the structure pointed to by
.IR name .
.PP
The 
.PN uname
system call uses the structure
defined in <sys/utsname.h> whose members are:
.PP
.RS
char	sysname[SYS_NMLN];
.br
char	nodename[SYS_NMLN];
.br
char	release[SYS_NMLN];
.br
char	version[SYS_NMLN];
.br
char	machine[SYS_NMLN];
.RE
.PP
The constant SYS_NMLN is defined in <limits.h>.
.PP
The
.PN uname
system call returns
a null-terminated character string naming the current ULTRIX
system in the character array
.IR sysname .
Similarly,
.I nodename
contains the name that the system
is known by on a communications network.  The
.I release
and
.I version
further identify the operating system.  The
.I machine
contains a standard name that identifies the hardware that the
ULTRIX system is running on.
.PP
Upon successful completion, a non-negative
value is returned.  Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
The
.PN uname
system call will fail if
.I name
points to an invalid address.
