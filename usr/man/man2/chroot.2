.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I dirname
is the address of the pathname of a directory,
terminated by a null byte.
The
.PN chroot
system call causes this directory
to become the root directory,
the starting point for path names beginning with ``/''.
.PP
In order for a directory to become the root directory
a process must have execute (search) access to the directory.
.PP
This call is restricted to the super-user.
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of \-1 is returned and \fIerrno\fP is set to indicate an error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.PN chroot
system call will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if
one or more of the following are true:
