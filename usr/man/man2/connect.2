.SH DESCRIPTION
The parameter
.I s
is a socket.
If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM,
then this call permanently specifies the peer to which
datagrams are to be sent;
if it is of type SOCK_STREAM,
then this call attempts to make a connection to
another socket.
The other socket is specified by
.I name
which is an address in the communications space of the socket.
Each communications space interprets the
.I name
parameter in its own way.
.PP
If the connection or binding succeeds, then 0 is returned.
Otherwise a \-1 is returned, and a more specific error
code is stored in \fIerrno\fP.
