.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN shmctl
system call
provides a variety of shared memory
control operations as specified by
.I cmd.
The following 
.I cmds
are available:
.TP 15
.B IPC_STAT
Place the current value of each member
of the data structure associated with
.I shmid
into the structure pointed to by 
.IR buf .
The contents of this structure are defined in
intro(2).
.TP 15
.B IPC_SET
Set the value of the following members
of the data structure associated with
.I shmid
to the corresponding value found
in the structure pointed to by
.IR buf :
.EX
shm_perm.uid
shm_perm.gid
shm_perm.mode    /* only low 9 bits */
.EE
.RS 8
.PP
This 
.I cmd
can only be executed by a process
that has an effective user ID equal to
either that of super user or to the value of
.B shm_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with 
.I shmid.
.RE
.TP 15
.B IPC_RMID
Remove the shared memory identifier specified by 
.I shmid
from the system and destroy the shared
memory segment and data structure
associated with it. This
.I cmd
can only be executed by a process that
has an effective user ID equal to
either that of super user or to the value of 
.B shm_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with
.IR shmid .
.TP 15
.B SHM_LOCK
Lock the shared memory segment specified by
.I shmid
in memory.
This 
.I cmd
can only be executed by a process that has an effective usr ID equal to
super user.
.TP 15
.B SHM_UNLOCK
Unlock the shared memory segment specified by
.I shmid.
This 
.I cmd
can only be executed by a process that has an effective usr ID equal to
super user.
.PP
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and 
.I errno 
is set to indicated the error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The
.PN shmctl
system call
will fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The
.I shmid
is not a valid shared memory identifier. 
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The
.I cmd
is not a valid command.  
.TP 15
[EACCES]
The
.I cmd
is equal to 
.B IPC_STAT
and read permission is
denied to the calling process.  For further information, see
intro(2). 
.TP 15
[EPERM]
The
.I cmd
is equal to 
.B IPC_RMID
or
.B IPC_SET
and the effective user ID of the
calling process is not equal to that of
super user and it is not equal to the value of 
.B shm_perm.uid
in the data structure associated with
.I shmid. 
.TP 15
[EPERM]
The
.I cmd
is equal to 
.B SHM_LOCK
or
.B SHM_UNLOCK
and the effective user ID of the calling process is not equal to that of 
super user.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The
.I cmd
is equal to 
.B SHM_LOCK 
and the shared memory segment is currently locked by
this process.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The
.I cmd
is equal to 
.B SHM_UNLOCK 
and the shared memory segment specified by 
.I shmid
is not currently locked in memory by
this process.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
The
.I buf
points to an illegal address.
