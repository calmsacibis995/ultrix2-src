.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rlogin
command connects your terminal on the current local host system
.I lhost
to the remote host system
.I rhost.
.PP
Each host has a file /etc/hosts.equiv
which contains a list of 
.I rhost
with which it shares account names.
The host names must be the standard names as described in
rsh(1c).
When you
.B rlogin
as the same user on an equivalent host, you don't need
to give a password.
Each user may also have a private equivalence list in a file \&.rhosts
in his login directory.  Each line in this file should contain a
.I rhost
and a \fIusername\fP separated by a space, giving additional cases
where logins without passwords are to be permitted.
If the originating user is not equivalent to the remote user, then
a login and password will be prompted for on the remote machine as in
login(1).
To avoid some security problems, the \&.rhosts file must be owned by
either the remote user or root and may not be a symbolic link.
.PP
Your remote terminal type is the same as your local
terminal type (as given in your environment TERM variable).
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for
delays) the rlogin is transparent.  Flow control via ^S and ^Q and
flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled properly.
A line of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host, where
``~'' is the escape character.  A different escape character may
be specified by the
.B \-e
option.
There is no space separating this option flag and the argument
character.
