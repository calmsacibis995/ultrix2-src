.SH SYNTAX
.B nm
[
.B \-agnopru
]
[ \fIfile\fR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nm
command
prints the name list (symbol table) of each object
.I file
in the argument list.  
If an argument is an archive, a listing for each object
file in the archive will be produced.  If no
.I file
is given, the ``a.out'' file is used.
.PP
Each symbol name is preceded by its value, which is blank if undefined,
and a letter.  The letter defines the symbol type:
.IP \fBU\fR 0.3i
Undefined
.IP \fBA\fR 0.3i
Absolute
.IP \fBT\fR 0.3i
Text segment symbol
.IP \fBD\fR 0.3i
Data segment symbol
.IP \fBB\fR 0.3i
Bss segment symbol
.IP \fBC\fR 0.3i
Common symbol
.IP \fBf\fR 0.3i
File name
.IP \fB\-\fR 0.3i
For 
.MS dbx 1
symbol table entries (see
.B \-a
option below).
.PP
If the symbol is local (non-external) the letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.
