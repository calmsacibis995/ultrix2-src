.TH passwd 1
.SH NAME
passwd \- change login password
.SH SYNTAX
.B passwd
[ name ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN passwd
command changes or installs a password
associated with the user
.I name
(your own name by default).
.PP
The program prompts for the old password and then for the new one.
The caller must supply both.
The new password must be typed twice, to forestall mistakes.
.PP
New passwords must be at least four characters long if they use
a sufficiently rich alphabet and at least six characters long
if monocase.
These rules are relaxed if you are insistent enough.
.PP
Only the owner of the name or the superuser may change a password;
the owner must prove he knows the old password.
.SH RESTRICTION
The
.PN passwd 
command will not change your password if your login entry
is served by
the yellow pages (YP) since the /etc/passwd 
file is referenced and not the yp map.  Refer to yppasswd(1yp)
for more information.
