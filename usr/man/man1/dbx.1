.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN dbx
debugger is a tool for source level debugging and execution
of programs under ULTRIX.
.PP
After invoking
.B dbx,
you can debug interactively by using the commands described
in the COMMANDS section.  If the file
.B .dbxinit
exists in the current directory, then the
.B dbx
commands in it are executed.  The user's home directory
is then checked for a 
.B .dbxinit
file, if the file does not exist in the current directory.
Note that the init file is built by appending the characters
.B init
to the first eight characters of the debugger's name.  For example,
if you renamed
.B dbx
to
.B abcdefghi ,
the debugger would look for an initialization file named
.B .abcdefghinit.
.SH ARGUMENTS
An object file produced by a compiler with the appropriate option
(usually ``\fB\-g\fR'') specified to produce symbol information
in the object file.  
The cc(1), f77(1), pc(1),
and the DIGITAL Modula-2 compiler,
mod(1), produce the appropriate source information.  The machine
level facilities of 
.B dbx
can be used on any program.
.PP
The object file contains a symbol table that includes the name
of all the source files translated by the compiler to create it. 
These files are available for perusal while using the debugger.
.PP
If no
.I objfile
is specified,
.B dbx
looks for a file named
.B a.out
in the current directory.
.PP
.I coredump
.PP
If a file named
.I core
exists in the current directory, or a
.I coredump
file is specified,
.B dbx 
can be used to examine the state of the program
when it faulted.
.SH OPTIONS
.nr In 8
.in +\n(Inn
.ta \n(Inn
.sp 1
.ti -\n(Inn
\&\fB\-r\fP	\c
Execute \fIobjfile\fP immediately.
If it terminates successfully,
.B dbx
exits.
Otherwise, the reason for termination will be reported
and the user offered the option of entering the debugger
or letting the program fault.
The
.B dbx
debugger
will read from /dev/tty 
when \fB\-r\fP is specified
and standard input is not a terminal.
.sp 1
.ti -\n(Inn
\&\fB\-i\fP	\c
Force 
.B dbx
to act as though standard input is a terminal.
.sp 1
.ti -\n(Inn
\&\fB\-k\fP	\c
Map memory addresses, useful for kernel debugging.
.sp 1
.ti -\n(Inn
\&\fB\-I\fP \fIdir\fP	\c
Add \fIdir\fP to the list of directories
that are searched when looking for a source file.
Normally,
.B dbx
looks for source files in the current directory
and in the directory where \fIobjfile\fP is located.
The directory search path can also be set with the \fBuse\fP command.
.sp 1
.ti -\n(Inn
\&\fB\-c\fP \fIfile\fP	\c
Execute the 
.B dbx
commands in the \fIfile\fP before
reading from standard input.
.in -\n(Inn
.sp 1
.PP
Unless \fB\-r\fP is specified, 
.B dbx
just prompts and waits for a command.

.TP
\fBrun\fP [\fIargs\fP] [\fB<\fP \fIfilename\fP] [\fB>\fP \fIfilename\fP]
.ns
.TP
\fBrerun\fP [\fIargs\fP] [\fB<\fP \fIfilename\fP] [\fB>\fP \fIfilename\fP]
Start executing \fIobjfile\fP, passing \fIargs\fP as command line arguments;
\fB<\fP or \fB>\fP can be used to redirect input or output in the usual manner.
When \fBrerun\fP is used without any arguments the previous
argument list is passed to the program;
otherwise it is identical to \fBrun\fP.
If \fIobjfile\fP has been written since the last time the symbolic information
was read in, 
.PN dbx 
will read in the new information.
.TP

.ns
.TP
\fBtrace\fP \fIvariable\fP [\fBin\fP \fIprocedure/function\fP] [\fBif\fP \fIcondition\fP]
Have tracing information printed when the program is executed.
A number is associated with the command that is used
to turn the tracing off (see the \fBdelete\fP command).
.sp 1
The first argument describes what is to be traced.
If it is a \fIsource-line-number\fP, then the line is printed
immediately prior to being executed.
Source line numbers in a file other than the current one
must be preceded by the name of the file in quotes and a colon, e.g.
"mumble.p":17.
.sp 1
If the argument is a procedure or function name then
every time it is called, information is printed telling
what routine called it, from what source line it was called,
and what parameters were passed to it.
In addition, its return is noted, and if it's a function
then the value it is returning is also printed.
.sp 1
If the argument is an \fIexpression\fP with an \fBat\fP clause
then the value of the expression is printed whenever the
identified source line is reached.
.sp 1
If the argument is a variable then the name and value of the variable
is printed whenever it changes.
Execution is substantially slower during this form of tracing.
.sp 1
If no argument is specified then all source lines are printed
before they are executed.
Execution is substantially slower during this form of tracing.
.sp 1
The clause ``\fBin\fP \fIprocedure/function\fP'' restricts tracing information
to be printed only while executing inside the given procedure
or function.
.sp 1
\fICondition\fP is a boolean expression and is
evaluated prior to printing the tracing information;
if it is false then the information is not printed.

.IP "\fBstop\fP \fBin\fP \fIprocedure/function\fP [\fBif\fP \fIcondition\fP]"
.ns
.IP "\fBstop\fP \fIvariable\fP [\fBif\fP \fIcondition\fP]"
Stop execution when the given line is reached, procedure or function
called, variable changed, or condition true.
.IP "\fBstatus\fP [\fB>\fP \fIfilename\fP]"
Print out the currently active \fBtrace\fP and \fBstop\fP commands.
.IP "\fBdelete\fP \fIcommand-number\fP ..."
The traces or stops corresponding to the given numbers are removed.
The numbers associated with traces and stops are printed by
the \fBstatus\fP command.  The command \fBdelete*\fP removes
all existing breakpoints and tracepoints at once.
.IP "\fBcatch\fP \fInumber\fP"
.ns
.IP "\fBcatch\fP \fIsignal-name\fP"
.ns
.IP "\fBignore\fP \fInumber\fP"
.ns
.IP "\fBignore\fP \fIsignal-name\fP"
Start or stop trapping a signal before it is sent
to the program.
This is useful when a program being debugged
handles signals such as interrupts.
A signal may be specified by number or by a name
(for example, SIGINT).
Signal names are case insensitive and the ``SIG'' prefix is optional.
By default all signals are trapped except SIGCONT, SIGCHILD,
SIGALRM and SIGKILL.
.IP "\fBcont\fP \fIinteger\fP"
.ns
.IP "\fBcont\fP \fIsignal-name\fP"
Continue execution from where it stopped.
If a signal is specified, the process continues as though
it received the signal.
Otherwise, program execution continues as if a signal had
not been encountered.
.IP ""
Execution cannot be continued if the process has 
called the standard procedure exit.
The
.PN dbx
debugger does not allow the process to exit, thereby
letting the user examine the program state.
.IP \fBstep\fP
Execute one source line.
.IP \fBnext\fP
Execute up to the next source line.
The difference between this and \fBstep\fP is that
if the line contains a call to a procedure or function
the \fBstep\fP command will stop at the beginning of that
block, while the \fBnext\fP command will not.
.IP "\fBreturn\fP [\fIprocedure\fP]"
Continue until a return to \fIprocedure\fP is executed, or
until the current procedure returns if none is specified.
.IP "\fBcall\fP \fIprocedure(parameters)\fP"
Execute the object code associated with the named procedure or function.
.sp 1

.PP
.SH Printing Variables and Expressions
Names are resolved first using the static scope of the current function,
then using the dynamic scope if the name is not defined
in the static scope.
If static and dynamic searches do not yield a result,
an arbitrary symbol is chosen and
the message ``[using\ \fIqualified\ name\fP]'' is printed.
The name resolution procedure may be overridden by qualifying an identifier
with a block name, e.g., ``\fImodule\fP.\fIvariable\fP''.
For C, source files are treated as modules named
by the file name without ``.c''.
.PP
Expressions are specified with an approximately
common subset of C and Pascal (or equivalently Modula-2) syntax.
Indirection can be denoted using either a prefix ``*'' or
a postfix ``^'' and
array expressions are subscripted by brackets (``[ ]'').
The field reference operator (``.'') can be used with pointers
as well as records, making the C operator ``->'' unnecessary
(although it is supported).
.PP
Types of expressions are checked;
the type of an expression may be overridden
by using ``(\fIexpression\fR)\\\fItype-name\fP''.
.sp 1
.IP "\fBassign\fP \fIvariable\fP \fB=\fP \fIexpression\fP"
Assign the value of the expression to the variable.
.IP "\fBdump\fP [\fIprocedure\fR] [\fB>\fP \fIfilename\fP]"
Print the names and values of variables in the given procedure,
or the current one if none is specified.
If the procedure given is ``.'', then the all active variables
are dumped.
.IP "\fBprint\fP \fIexpression\fP [\fB,\fP \fIexpression\fP ...]"
Print out the values of the expressions.
.IP "\fBwhatis\fP \fIname\fP"
Print the declaration of the given name, which may be qualified
with block names as above.
.IP "\fBwhich\fP \fIidentifier\fP"
Print the full qualification of the given identifier, i.e.
the outer blocks that the identifier is associated with.
.IP "\fBup\fP [\fIcount\fP]"
.ns
.IP "\fBdown\fP [\fIcount\fP]"
Move the current function, which is used for resolving names,
up or down the stack \fIcount\fP levels.
The default \fIcount\fP is 1.
.IP \fBwhere\fP
Print out a list of the active procedures and function.
.IP "\fBwhereis\fP \fIidentifier\fP"
Print the full qualification of all the symbols whose
name matches the given identifier.
The order in which the symbols are printed is not meaningful.
.SH Accessing Source Files
.IP "/\fIregular\ expression\fP[/]"
.ns
.IP "?\fIregular\ expression\fP[?]"
Search forward or backward in the current source file
for the given pattern.
.IP "\fBedit\fP [\fIfilename\fP]"
.ns
.IP "\fBedit\fP \fIprocedure/function-name\fP"
Invoke an editor on \fIfilename\fP or the current source file if none
is specified.
If a \fIprocedure\fP or \fIfunction\fP name is specified,
the editor is invoked on the file that contains it.
Which editor is invoked by default depends on the installation.
The default can be overridden by setting the environment variable
EDITOR to the name of the desired editor.
.IP "\fBfile\fP [\fIfilename\fP]"
Change the current source file name to \fIfilename\fP.
If none is specified then the current source file name is printed.
.IP "\fBfunc\fP [\fIprocedure/function\fP]"
Change the current function.
If none is specified then print the current function.
Changing the current function implicitly changes the current source file
to the one that contains the function; it also changes the current scope
used for name resolution.
.IP "\fBlist\fP [\fIsource-line-number\fP [\fB,\fP \fIsource-line-number\fP]]"
.ns
.IP "\fBlist\fP \fIprocedure/function\fP"
List the lines in the current source file from the first line number to
the second inclusive.
If no lines are specified, the next 10 lines are listed.
If the name of a procedure or function is given
lines \fIn-k\fP to \fIn+k\fP are listed where \fIn\fP is the first statement
in the procedure or function and \fIk\fP is small.
.IP "\fBuse\fP \fIdirectory-list\fP"
Set the list of directories to be searched
when looking for source files.
.SH Command Aliases and Variables

.ns
.TP
\fBalias\fP \fIname\fP ``\fIstring\fP''
.ns
.TP
\fBalias\fP \fIname\fP (\fIparameters\fP) ``\fIstring\fP''
When commands are processed,
.PN dbx
first checks to see if the word
is an alias for either a command or a string.
If it is an alias, then 
.PN dbx
treats the input as though
the corresponding string (with values substituted for any parameters)
had been entered.
For example,
to define an alias ``rr'' for the command ``rerun'',
one can say
.sp 1
.in +8n
alias rr rerun
.in -8n
.sp 1
To define an alias called ``b'' that sets a stop at a particular line
one can say
.sp 1
.in +8n
alias b(x) ``stop at x''
.in -8n
.sp 1
Subsequently, the command ``b(12)'' will expand to ``stop at 12''.
.need 5
.TP
\fBset\fP \fIname\fP [= \fIexpression\fP]
The \fBset\fP command defines values for debugger variables.
The names of these variables cannot conflict with names in the program
being debugged, and are expanded to the corresponding expression
within other commands.
The following variables have a special meaning:
.sp 1
.in +8n
.ti -5n
$frame
.br
Setting this variable to an address causes 
.PN dbx
to use the stack frame
pointed to by the address for
doing stack traces and accessing local variables.
This facility is of particular use for kernel debugging.
.sp 1
.ti -5n
$hexchars
.ti -5n
$hexints
.ti -5n
$hexoffsets
.ti -5n
$hexstrings
.br
When set, 
.PN dbx
prints 
out characters, integers, offsets from registers, or character pointers
respectively in hexadecimal.
.sp 1
.ti -5n
$listwindow
.br
The value of this variable specifies the number
of lines to list around a function or when the \fBlist\fP command
is given without any parameters.
Its default value is 10.
.sp 1
.ti -5n
$mapaddrs
.br
Setting (unsetting) this variable causes 
.PN dbx
to start (stop)
mapping addresses.
As with ``$frame'', this is useful for kernel debugging.
.sp 1
.ti -5n
$unsafecall
.ti -5n
$unsafeassign
.br
When ``$unsafecall'' is set,
strict type checking is turned off for arguments to
subroutine or function calls (\fIe.g.\fP in the \fBcall\fP statement).
When ``$unsafeassign'' is set,
strict type checking between the two sides
of an \fBassign\fP statement is turned off.
These variables should be used only with great care,
because they severely limit 
.PN dbx 's
usefulness
for detecting errors.
.in -8n
.TP
\fBunalias\fP \fIname\fP
Remove the alias with the given name.
.TP
\fBunset\fP \fIname\fP
Delete the debugger variable associated with \fIname\fP.

\fIaddress\fP \fB,\fP\fIaddress\fP\fB/\fP [\fImode\fP]
.ns
.TP
\fIaddress\fP \fB/\fP [\fIcount\fP] [\fImode\fP]
Print the contents of memory starting at the first \fIaddress\fP
and continuing up to the second \fIaddress\fP or until \fIcount\fP items are printed.
If the address is ``.'', the address following the one
printed most recently is used.
The \fImode\fP specifies how memory is to be printed;
if it is omitted the previous mode specified is used.
The initial mode is ``X''.
The following modes are supported:
.nr In 5
.in +\n(Inn

.in -\n(Inn
.sp 1
.PP
Symbolic addresses are specified by preceding the name with an ``&''.
Registers are denoted by ``$rN'' where N is the number of the register.
Addresses may be expressions made up of other addresses and
the operators ``+'', ``-'', and indirection (unary ``*'').
.SH Miscellaneous Commands
.IP \fBhelp\fP
Print out a synopsis of 
.PN dbx
commands.
.IP "\fBquit\fP"
Exit 
.PN dbx .
.IP "\fBsh\fP \fIcommand-line\fP"
Pass the command line to the shell for execution.
The SHELL environment variable determines which shell is used.
.TP
\fBsource\fP \fIfilename\fP
Read 
.B dbx
commands from the given \fIfilename\fP.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
If you have a program consisting of several object files and
each is built from source files that include header files,
the symbolic information for the header files is replicated
in each object code file.  Since about one debugger startup
is done for each link, having the linker ld(1)
reorganize the symbol information won't save much time,
although it would reduce some of the disk space used.  
.PP
The
problem is an artifact of the unrestricted semantics of
#include statements in C.  For example, an include
file can contain static declarations that are separate
entities for each file in which they are included.  However,
even with Modula-2 there is a substantial amount of
duplication of symbol information necessary for inter-module
type checking.
.PP
Some problems remain with the support for individual languages.
Fortran problems include: (a) inability to assign to logical,
logical*2, complex, and double complex variables, (b) inability
to represent parameter constants which are not type integer
or real, (c) peculiar representation for the values of dummy
procedures.  (The value shown for a dummy procedure is actually
the first few bytes of the procedure text.  To find the
location of the procedure, use ``&'' to take the address of
the variable.)
