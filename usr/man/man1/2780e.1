.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN 2780e
command puts the files named as arguments, 
along with a single control file which guides each file's execution,
into
.PN usr/spool/rje 
and calls the
.PN 2780d
program. 
This program
sends the files to the IBM system.
.PP
The following options may be needed to
format data transmitted to an IBM system. 
.IP \fB\-m\fR 0.3i
Send mail when the file has been sent and when
output from the submitted file has been received successfully.
.IP \fB\-a\fR 0.3i
Send as a priority job. Used only by the superuser. 
This file will be placed ahead of the next regular file or at the
end of other priority jobs.
.IP \fB\-q\fR 0.3i
Prepare the file for transmission and place it in /usr/spool/rje
but do not call 2780d to transmit the file.
.IP \fB\-b\fR 0.3i
Transmit the file to an IBM system that accepts 
multiple record transmission.
.IP \fB\-t\fR 0.3i
Send the data in transparent mode. This option is used for
files which contain special control or protocol characters.
.IP \fB\-S\fR 0.3i
Send the contents of the file to the IBM
as a sign-on card.  If this option is not specified, a
default sign-on card in the spool area is used.
.IP \fB\-#\fR 0.3i
Wait for
.I num
files to be received as output from your job and give them
default file names which have
the form 
.I Ruseridpid.
.IP \fB\-o\fR 0.3i
Name the files received as output from
your job with file names that you create.
This option must be at the end of the command line.
Anything listed after this option is interpreted as
an output file name.
