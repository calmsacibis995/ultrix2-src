.SH SYNTAX
.B lisp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lisp
is a lisp interpreter for a dialect which
closely resembles MIT's M\s-2ACLISP\s0.
This lisp, known as F\s-2RANZ\s0\ L\s-2ISP\s0, features
an I/O facility which allows the user to change the input
and output syntax, add
macro characters, and maintain compatibility with upper-case
only lisp systems;
infinite precision integer arithmetic, and
an error facility which allows the user to trap system errors in 
many different ways.
Interpreted functions may be mixed with code compiled by
.IR liszt (1)
and both may be debugged using the
``Joseph Lister'' trace package.
A
.I lisp
containing compiled and interpreted code may be dumped into
a file for later use.
.LP
There are too many functions to list here; one should refer to the
manuals listed below.
