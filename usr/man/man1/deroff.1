.SH NAME
deroff \- remove nroff, troff, tbl and eqn constructs
.SH SYNTAX
.B deroff
[
.B \-w
]
.I file...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B deroff
command
reads each file in sequence and removes all
.B nroff
and
.B troff
command lines, backslash constructions, macro definitions,
.B eqn
constructs (between `.EQ' and `.EN' lines or between delimiters),
and table descriptions and writes the remainder on the standard output.
The
.B deroff
command
follows chains of included files (`.so' and `.nx' commands);
if a file has already been included, a `.so' is ignored and a `.nx'
terminates execution.  If no input file is given,
.B deroff
reads from the standard input file.
.PP
If the
.B \-w
flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of letters,
digits, and apostrophes, beginning with a letter;
apostrophes are removed)
per line, and all other characters ignored.
Otherwise, the output follows the original,
with the deletions mentioned above.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
The
.B deroff
command
is not a complete
.B troff
interpreter, so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.
.br
The
.B \-w 
flag removes every one or two character word.
