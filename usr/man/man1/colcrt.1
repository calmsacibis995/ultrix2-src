.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B colcrt
command
provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
is destructive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `\-')
are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.
.PP
The optional
.B \- 
suppresses all underlining.
It is especially useful for previewing
.I allboxed
tables from
tbl(1).
.PP
The option
.B \-2
causes all half-lines to be printed,
effectively double spacing the output.
Normally, a minimal space output format
is used which will suppress empty lines.
The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however.
The
.B \-2
option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output
contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.
.PP
A typical use of
.B colcrt
would be
.PP
.DT
	tbl exum2.n | nroff \-ms | colcrt \- | more
.SH RESTRICTIONS

.PP
General overstriking is lost;
as a special case `|' overstruck with `\-' or underline becomes `+'.
.PP
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
