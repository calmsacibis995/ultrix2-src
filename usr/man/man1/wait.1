.TH wait 1 
.SH NAME
wait \- await completion of process
.SH SYNTAX
.B wait
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B wait
command
waits until all processes started with
.B &
have completed,
and report on abnormal terminations.
.PP
Because the
wait(2)
system call must be executed in the parent process,
the Shell itself executes
.B wait,
without creating a new process.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage
pipeline are children of the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.
