.SH NAME
calendar \- reminder service
.SH SYNTAX
.B calendar
[ \- ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B calendar 
command consults the file `calendar' in the current directory
and prints out lines that contain today's or
tomorrow's date anywhere in the line.
Most reasonable month-day dates such as `Dec. 7,'
`december 7,' `12/7,' etc., are recognized, but not
`7 December' or `7/12'.
If you give the month as ``*''
with a date, i.e. ``* 1'', that day in any month will do.
On weekends `tomorrow' extends through Monday.
.PP
When 
an argument is present,
.B calendar
does its job for every user
who has a file `calendar' in his login directory
and sends him any positive results by
mail(1).
Normally this is done daily in the wee hours under control of
cron(8).
.PP
The file `calendar' is first run through the ``C'' preprocessor,
/lib/cpp,
to include any other calendar files
specified with the usual ``#include'' syntax.
Included calendars will usually be shared by all users,
maintained and documented by the local administration.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
The
.B calendar's
extended idea of `tomorrow' doesn't account for
holidays.
