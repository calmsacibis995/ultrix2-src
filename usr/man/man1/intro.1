.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon termination each command returns two bytes of status,
one supplied by the system giving the cause for
termination and, in the case of ``normal'' termination,
one supplied by the program, see
.PN wait
and exit(2).
The former byte is 0 for normal termination; the latter
is customarily 0 for successful execution.  
Nonzero to indicate troubles such as erroneous parameters,
bad or inaccessible data,
or other inability to cope with the task at hand.
It is called variously ``exit code'', ``exit status'' or
``return code,'' and is described only where
special conventions are involved.
