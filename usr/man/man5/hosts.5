This file is normally created from the official host
data base maintained at the Network Information Control
Center (NIC), though local changes may be required
to bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases
and/or unknown hosts.

``.'' notation using the \fIinet_addr\fP() routine
from the Internet address manipulation library,
