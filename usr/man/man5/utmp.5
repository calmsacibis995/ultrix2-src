.SH NAME
utmp, wtmp \- login records
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <utmp.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN utmp
file records information about who is currently using the system.
The file is a sequence of entries with the following
structure declared in the include file:
.EX 0

struct utmp {
        char    ut_line[8];             /* tty name */
        char    ut_name[8];             /* user id */
        char    ut_host[16];            /* host name, if remote */
        long    ut_time;                /* time on */
};

.EE
.PP
This structure gives the name of the special file
associated with the user's terminal, the user's login name,
and the time of the login in the form of time(3c).
.PP
The
.PN wtmp
file records all logins and logouts.
A null user name indicates a logout on the associated terminal.
Furthermore, the terminal name `~' indicates that the
system was rebooted at the indicated time;
the adjacent pair of entries with terminal names
`\^|\^' and `}' indicate the system-maintained time just before and just after a
.I date
command has changed the system's idea of the time.
.PP
The
.PN wtmp
file is maintained by login(1)
and init(8).
Neither of these programs creates the file,
so if it is removed record-keeping is turned off.  It is summarized by
ac(8).
