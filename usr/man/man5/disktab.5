.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN disktab
file
is a simple date base which describes disk geometries and
disk partition characteristics.  The format is patterned
after the termcap(5) terminal data base.  Entries in 
.PN disktab
consist of a number of `:' separated fields.  The
first entry for each disk gives the names which are
known for the disk, separated by `|' characters.  The
last name given should be a long name fully identifying
the disk. 
.PP
The following list indicates the normal values
stored for each disk entry.
