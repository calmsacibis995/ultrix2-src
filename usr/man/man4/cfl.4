All I/O is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should be a multiple
of 128 bytes and a multiple of 128 bytes should be transferred,
as in other ``raw'' disk interfaces.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Multiple console floppies are not supported.
.PP
If a write is given with a count not a multiple of 128 bytes then
the trailing portion of the last sector will be zeroed.
