.SH DESCRIPTION
A small vax monochrome display subsystem
provides a half page or full page user accessible bit map
display for graphics applications.
The device consists of a 128kb block of dual port RAM,
a VSXXX-AA mouse or VSXXX-AB tablet, and a 19 inch video monitor.
.PP
The model supported by the driver is a hybrid terminal with three minor devices.
The first minor device emulates a glass tty with a
screen that appears as a 120 column
by 80 row page that scrolls from the bottom.
This device is capable of being configured as the system console.
.PP
The second minor device is reserved for the mouse.
This device is a source of mouse state changes.
(a state change defined as an X/Y axis mouse movement or button change).
When opened, the driver couples movements of the mouse with the cursor.
Mouse position changes are filtered and translated into cursor position
changes in an exponential manner.
Rapid movements result in large cursor position changes.
All cursor positions are range checked to insure that the cursor remains on
the display.
.PP
The third minor device provides an access path for console output
that does not disturb the graphics display.
The caller can open the device /dev/smscreen.
When this device is open, the small vax monochrome driver
redirects console device output to the input buffer of this device.
This mechanism disables
console output on the small vax monochrome screen and saves
the output for 
later display. This preserves the graphic display integrity.
.PP
Input and output on the first and third minor devices are processed by
the standard line disciplines.
.PP
If there is not a special cable (BCC08) on serial port 
#3 (printer port), and
the optional video board is not present
(or failed the selftest), the system
will then use the monochrome video as the system console.
All input/output destined for /dev/console uses the monochrome video
instead.  (This is done by overwriting the device switch tables.)
There is a second set of device switch entries configured which may be
be used as an additional terminal, TIP/UUCP (hardwire, modem, or auto-dialer)
connection, or user dialup access. For further information, see ss(4).
.sp
The Hold Screen key is supported. The small vax monochrome driver treats this
key as if ^S or ^Q is typed.
Pressing this key suspends the output if it is not already suspended. The output
will be resumed by pressing this key again (if the output was suspended).
