.SH SYNTAX
.B "device kg0 at uba0 csr 0176500 vector kglock"
.SH DESCRIPTION
A kl-11 or dl-11w can be used as an alternate real
time clock
source.  When configured, certain system
statistics and, optionally, system profiling work
will be collected each time the clock interrupts.  For
optimum accuracy in profiling, the dl-11w should be
configured to interrupt at the highest possible priority
level.  The 
.I kg
device driver automatically calibrates itself to the
line clock frequency.
