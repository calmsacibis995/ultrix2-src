.SH NAME
en \- Xerox 3 Mb/s Ethernet interface
.SH SYNTAX
.B "device en0 at uba0 csr 0161000 vector enrint enxint encollide"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I en
interface provides access to a 3 Mb/s Ethernet network.
Due to limitations in the hardware, DMA transfers
to and from the network must take place in the lower 64K bytes
of the UNIBUS address space.
.PP
The network number is specified with a SIOCSIFADDR ioctl; the
host's address is discovered by probing the on-board Ethernet
address register.  No packets will be sent or accepted until 
a network number is supplied.
.PP
The interface software implements an exponential backoff algorithm
when notified of a collision on the cable.  This algorithm utilizes
a 16-bit mask and the VAX-11's interval timer in calculating a series
of random backoff values.  The algorithm is as follows:
.TP 5
1.
Initialize the mask to be all 1's.
.TP 5
2.
If the mask is zero, 16 retries have been made and we give
up.
.TP 5
3.
Shift the mask left one bit and formulate a backoff by
masking the interval timer with the mask (this is actually
the two's complement of the value).
.TP 5
4.
Use the value calculated in step 3 to delay before retransmitting
the packet.
.PP
The interface handles both Internet and PUP protocol families,
with the interface address maintained in Internet format.
PUP addresses are converted to Internet addresses by subsituting
PUP network and host values for Internet network and local part
values.
.PP
The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsulation
to minimize copying data on input and output.  This may be
disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR "en%d: output error" .
The hardware indicated an error on
the previous transmission.
.PP
.BR "en%d: send error" .
After 16 retransmissions using the
exponential backoff algorithm described above, the packet
was dropped.
.PP
.BR "en%d: input error" .
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet off the cable.
.PP
.BR "en%d: can't handle af%d" .
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
