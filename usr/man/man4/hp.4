.TH hp 4
.SH NAME
hp \- MASSBUS disk interface
.SH SYNTAX
.B "disk hp0 at mba0 drive 0"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``hp'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
The block file's access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.	There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.PP
Standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register.
The origin and size (in sectors) of the partitions
on each drive are as follows:

It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one installation,
since there is overlap in addresses and protection becomes
a sticky matter.
The hp?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the hp?b partition as a paging area,
and the hp?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
On disks larger than about 205 Megabytes, the hp?h partition
is inserted prior to the hp?d or hp?g partition;
the hp?g partition then maps the remainder of the pack.
All disk partition tables are calculated using the
diskpart(8)
program.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
In raw I/O
.I read (2)
and
write(2)
truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and
.I write
scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.I read, write
and
lseek(2)
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following messages are printed at the console and noted
in the error log file:
.PP
\fBhp%d%c: hard error sn%d\fR.
.br
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified sector
of the named disk partition.
Either the error was unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.  Additional register information may be
gathered from the system error log file
/usr/adm/syserr/syserr.<hostname>.
.PP
\fBhp%d: write locked\fR.
.br
The write protect switch was set on the drive when a write was
attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBhp%d: not ready\fR.
.br
The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.  The i/o operation is not recoverable.
.PP
During autoconfiguration one of the following messages may appear
on the console indicating the appropriate drive type was recognized.
The last message indicates the drive is of a unknown type.
.PP
The following message is written to the system error log file only.
.PP
\fBhp%d%c: soft ecc sn%d\fR.
.br
A recoverable ECC error occurred on the specified sector of the
named disk partition.
This happens normally a few times a week.
If it happens more frequently than this,
the sectors where the errors are occurring should be checked to see
if certain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive
or heads are indicated.
