.SH DESCRIPTION
The MAKEDEV shell script is normally used to install
special files.	It resides in the /dev
directory, as this is the normal location of special files.
Arguments to MAKEDEV are usually of the form
.IR device-name ?
where
.I device-name
is one of the supported devices listed in section 4 of the
manual and ``?'' is a logical unit number.  A few
special arguments create assorted collections of devices and are
listed below.
.TP
.B boot*
Create all
.I boot*
and standard devices for a specific cpu type, for example, "boot8800".
.TP
.B mvax*
Create
.I MicroVAX
specific devices. This is superseded by the boot argument.
.TP
.B VAXstation*
VAXstation 2200 specific setup. This is superseded by the boot argument.
.TP
.B std
Create all
.I standard
devices for all systems.
.TP
.B local
Create those devices specific to the local site.  This
request causes the shell file
/dev/MAKEDEV.local
to be executed.  Site specific commands, such as those
used to setup dialup lines as ``ttyd?'' should be included
in this file.
.PP
Since all devices are created using
mknod(8),
this shell script is useful only to the super-user.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Either self-explanatory, or generated by one of the programs
called from the script.  Use ``sh -x MAKEDEV'' in case of
trouble.
