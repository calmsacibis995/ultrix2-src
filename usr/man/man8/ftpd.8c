.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.PN ftpd
server is the DARPA Internet File Transfer Protocol
server process.  The server uses the TCP protocol
and is invoked by
inetd(8c)
when it receives a connection on the port specified in the ``ftp''
service specification.  For further information, see
.PN services(5).
.PP
If the 
.B \-d
option is specified,
certain debugging messages printed by ftpd will
be enabled.
.PP
If the
.B \-l
option is specified,
each ftp session is logged on the standard output.
This allows a line of the form 
`/etc/ftpd -l > /tmp/ftplog''
to be used to conveniently maintain a log of ftp sessions.
.PP
The ftp server
will timeout an inactive session after 60 seconds.
If the
.B \-t
option is specified,
the inactivity timeout period will be set to
.IR timeout .
.PP
The 
.PN ftp
server currently supports the following
.PN ftp
requests.  Case is not distinguished.

.PP
The remaining 
.PN ftp
requests specified in Internet RFC 765 are
recognized, but not implemented.
.PP
The
.PN ftpd
server interprets file names according to the ``globbing''
conventions used by
.PN csh(1).
This allows users to utilize the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.
.PP
The
.PN ftpd
server authenticates users according to three rules. 
.IP 1)
The user name must be in the password data base,
/etc/passwd,
and not have a null password.  In this case a password
must be provided by the client before any file operations
may be performed.
.IP 2)
The user name must not appear in the file
/etc/ftpusers.
.IP 3)
If the user name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an
anonymous 
.PN ftp
account must be present in the password
file (user ``ftp'').  In this case the user is allowed
to log in by specifying any password (by convention this
is given as the client host's name).
.PP
In the last case, 
.PN ftpd
takes special measures to restrict the client's access privileges.
The server performs a 
.PN chroot(2)
command to the home directory of the ``ftp'' user.
In order that system security is not breached, it is recommended
that the ``ftp'' subtree be constructed with care;  the following
rules are recommended.
.IP ~ftp)
Make the home directory owned by ``ftp'' and unwritable by anyone.
.IP ~ftp/bin)
Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwritable by
anyone.  The program 
.PN ls(1)
must be present to support the list commands.  This
program should have mode 111.
.IP ~ftp/etc)
Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwritable by
anyone.  The files passwd(5) and group(5)
must be present for the 
.PN ls
command to work properly.  These files should be mode 444.
.IP ~ftp/pub)
Make this directory mode 777 and owned by ``ftp''.  Users
should then place files which are to be accessible via the
anonymous account in this directory.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
There is no support for aborting commands.
.PP
The anonymous account is inherently dangerous and should
avoided when possible.
.PP
The server must run as the super-user
to create sockets with privileged port numbers.  It maintains
an effective user id of the logged in user, reverting to
the super-user only when binding addresses to sockets.  The
possible security holes have been extensively
scrutinized, but are possibly incomplete.
