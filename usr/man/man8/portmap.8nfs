.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "portmap command"  ""  "\fLportmap\fP \(em DARPA to RPC mapper"
.IX  "DARPA to RPC mapper"  ""  "DARPA to RPC mapper \(em \fLportmap\fP"
The
.PN portmap
command is a server that converts RPC program numbers
into DARPA protocol port numbers.
When an RPC server is started, it will tell
.PN portmap
what TCP or UDP port number it is listening on,
and what RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.
.PP
It is important to understand that
.PN portmap
must first be invoked before attempting to run any RPC service. 
It must be running in order to use any RPC-based applications, including
the NFS mount daemon, mountd(8nfs).
When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number,
the RPC program will first contact
.PN portmap
on the server machine to determine
the port number where the RPC packets should be sent.
.PP
If
.PN portmap
crashes, all servers must be restarted.
