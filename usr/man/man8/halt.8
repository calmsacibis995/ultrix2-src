.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Halt
writes out sandbagged information to the disks and then stops
the processor.  The machine does not reboot, even if the auto-reboot
switch is set on the console.
.PP
The
.B \-n
option prevents the sync before stopping.  The
.B \-q
option causes a quick halt, no graceful shutdown is attempted.  The
.B \-y
option is needed if you are trying to halt the system from a dialup.
.SH SEE ALSO
reboot(8), shutdown(8)
.SH RESTRICTIONS
It is very difficult to halt a VAX, as the machine wants to then
reboot itself.  A rather tight loop suffices.
