.TH rc 8
.SH NAME
rc \- command script for auto-reboot and daemons
.SH SYNTAX
.B /etc/rc
.br
.B /etc/rc.local
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN rc
command script controls the automatic reboot and 
.PN rc.local
is the script holding commands which are pertinent only
to a specific site.
.PP
When an automatic reboot is in progress,
.PN rc
is invoked with the argument
.I autoboot
and runs a
.PN fsck
with option
.B \-p
to ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting
from the last system shutdown and to check for serious inconsistencies
caused by hardware or software failure.
If this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the second part of
.PN rc
is run.
.PP
The second part of
.PN rc,
which is run after a auto-reboot succeeds and also if
.PN rc
is invoked when a single user shell terminates, 
starts all the daemons on the system, preserves editor files
and clears the scratch directory
.B /tmp.
For further information, see init(8).  The
.PN rc.local
command
is executed immediately before any other commands after a successful
.PN fsck.
Normally, the first commands placed in the rc.local
file define the machine's name, using hostname(1),
and save any possible core image that might have been
generated as a result of a system crash, savecore(8).
The latter command is included in the rc.local
file because the directory in which core dumps are saved
is usually site specific.
