Without any arguments,
.PN lpc
will prompt for commands from the standard input.
If arguments are supplied,
.PN lpc
interprets the first argument as a command and the remaining
arguments as parameters to the command.  The standard input
may be redirected causing
.PN lpc
to read commands from file.
Commands may be abbreviated;
the following is the list of recognized commands.

Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
.IR lpr )
for the specified printers.
.TP
clean { all | printer ... }

Remove all files beginning with ``cf'', ``tf'', or ``df''
from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.

to put new jobs in the spool queue.
.TP
exit
.TP
quit
.br
Exit from lpc.
.TP

.br
Turn the specified printer queues off.  This prevents new
printer jobs from being entered into the queue by
.PN lpr .
.TP
restart { all | printer ... }
.br
Attempt to start a new printer daemon. 
This is useful when some abnormal condition causes the daemon to

will report that there is no daemon present when this condition occurs. 
.TP
start { all | printer ... }
.br

command also creates an ``init'' file

Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.
.TP
