.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.PN miscd
daemon is the service daemon for 
some utility internet services.
It is started by
.PN inetd(8c)
when it receives a packet or a connection on an appropriate socket.
Once invoked,
.PN miscd
determines the type of request and the protocol and then attempts
to service it.
.PP
When performing services for datagram functions, the daemon will
stay active until approximately two minutes pass without a service
request.  It will then terminate until reinvoked by inetd(8c).
.PP
Invocations of
.PN miscd
serving for connection-based sockets will terminate when the
connection is broken.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
The
.PN miscd
daemon supports only a subset of the internet utility functions.
The supported services are echo, discard, systat, daytime, quote,
chargen, and time.
