.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to mathematical library functions
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions constitute the math library,
.I libm.
They are automatically loaded as needed by the Fortran compiler
.IR f77 (1).
The link editor searches this library under the \*(lq\-lm\*(rq option.
Declarations for these functions may be obtained from the include file
.RI < math.h >.
.PP					.\" Begin
The GFLOAT version of
.IR libm
is used when you use the
.IR ld(1)
command with the  
.B lcg
option. 
Note that you must use 
the GFLOAT version of
.IR libm
with modules compiled using the
.IR cc(1)
with the 
.B \-Mg
option. 
.PP
Note that neither the compiler nor the linker
.IR ld(1)
can detect when mixed double floating point
types are used, and the program may produce
erroneous results if this occurs.
.SH SYSTEM V COMPATIBILITY
This library contains System V compatibility features
that are available to general ULTRIX programs.  For a discussion
of how these features are documented, and how to specify that
the System V environment is to be used in compiling and linking
your programs,
see
