end, etext, edata \- last locations in program
.SH SYNTAX

.B extern end;
.B extern etext;
.B extern edata;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These names refer neither to routines nor to locations with interesting
contents.  The address of
.PN etext
is the first address above the program text,
.PN edata
above the initialized data region, and
.PN end
above the uninitialized data region.
.PP
When execution begins, the program break coincides with
.PN end,
but it is reset by the routines
brk(2), malloc(3), standard input/output
stdio(3s),
the profile
.RB ( \-p )
option of 
cc(1),
and so forth.
The current value of the program break
is reliably returned by `sbrk(0)',
see brk(2).
