.SH NAME
alarm \- schedule signal after specified time
.SH SYNTAX
.nf
.B alarm(seconds)
.B unsigned seconds;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.PN alarm
subroutine
causes signal SIGALRM, see signal(3),
to be sent to the invoking process
in a number of seconds given by the argument.
Unless caught or ignored, the signal terminates the process.
.PP
Alarm requests are not stacked.  Successive calls reset the alarm clock.
If the argument is 0, any alarm request is canceled.
Because of scheduling delays,
resumption of execution of when the signal is
caught may be delayed an arbitrary amount.
The longest specifiable delay time is 2147483647 seconds.
.PP
The return value is the amount of time
previously remaining in the alarm clock.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When your program is compiled using the System V environment,
.PN alarm
returns unsigned int, and rounds the number of seconds
returned by the number of microseconds.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
sigpause(2), sigvec(2), signal(3), sleep(3)
