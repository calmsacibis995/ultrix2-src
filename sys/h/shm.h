/*
 *
 *   Modification history:
 *
 * 27 Jan 87 -- depp
 *	Cleaned up some of the incompatibilities between SYSTEM V and
 *	ULTRIX-32 naming conventions
 *
 * 29 Apr 86 -- depp
 *	Moved some shared memory constants from param.h to here, except 
 *	SMMIN, SMMAX, SMBRK which are configurable.  The defaults
 *	for these 3 constants is in /sys/conf/param.c.  Plus, the data
 *	element "small" removed from struct sminfo.
 *
 * 18 Mar 86 -- depp
 *	Changed struct smem.  The sm_daddr member is now a pointer rather
 *	than an array, so that an array can be dynamically allocated to
 *	handle any size request.
 *
 * 18 Sep 85 -- depp
 *	Added SMNOSW flag and sm_lcount for page locking
 *
 * 08 April 85 -- depp
 *	New file for System V shared memory
 *
